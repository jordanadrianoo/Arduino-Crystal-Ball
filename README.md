# Arduino Crystal Ball

This Arduino project is inspired by the "Arduino Projects Book" project 11 by Scogg Fitzgerald and Michael Shiloh. This Project uses a LCD Screen to display responses to yes or no questions. This project replicates the infamous "magic 8 ball", but without the shaking. The user will ask the Arduino a question and press a button for the response.
